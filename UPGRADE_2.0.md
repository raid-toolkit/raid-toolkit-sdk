# Raid Toolkit 2.x Update Release Notes

This release now includes an installer for fresh installs. Upgrades from 1.x clients will automatically direct to the new launcher experience to install the latest version.

## Breaking Changes
 * **Raid Toolkit now requires Windows 10.0.19041 or later.** If you are using an older version of Windows, you will need to upgrade before you can run RTK v2.x.
 * Extensions written against RTK v1.x need to be rebuilt by their authors for v2.x. If you are using a v1.x extension, contact the author for a new version before upgrading to 2.x.

## Major Improvements/Changes
 * Game model updates now complete in a few seconds and not several minutes.
 * New WinUI3 experience, with native dark mode support
