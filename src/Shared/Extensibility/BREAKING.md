# Breaking changes log

## New APIs in 3.0

### `IAppDispatcher`

The `IAppDispatcher` interface provides a way to execute code on the UI thread.  This interface is intended to replace the `IAppUI` interface, which was originally created for internal use in the RTK application, but provided vital functionality for executing code on the UI thread.  This interface provides the same functionality without coupling to RTK Application specific contracts.

### `IWindowManager`

The `IWindowManager` interface provides a way to create and manage windows.  This interface is intended to replace methods on the `IExtensionHost` interface for a more modular API surface.

## Breaking changes in 3.0

### TODO

* Backport `IAppDispatcher` from 3.0

### `IExtensionHost` removed APIs

#### Window APIs

`RegisterWindow` and `CreateWindow` have been removed.
Use [`IWindowManager`](#iwindowmanager) instead.

<summary>üë©‚Äçüíª Upgrade instructions</summary>

##### Before

```cs
class MyExtension : ExtensionPackage
{
    public override void OnActivate(IExtensionHost host)
    {
        host.RegisterWindow<MyWindow>(new WindowOptions() { /*...*/ });
        host.CreateWindow<MyWindow>();
    }
}
```

##### After

```cs
class MyExtension : ExtensionPackage
{
    private readonly IWindowManager WindowManager;
    public MyExtension(IWindowManager windowManager)
    {
        WindowManager = windowManager;
    }
    public override void OnActivate(IExtensionHost _unused_)
    {
        WindowManager.RegisterWindow<MyWindow>(new WindowOptions() { /*...*/ });
        host.CreateWindow<MyWindow>();
    }
}
```

</details>

### `IAppUI` interface deprecated

The `IAppUI` interface was originally created for internal use in the RTK application, but provided vital functionality for executing code on the UI thread.  This interface has been deprecated in favor of the [`IAppDispatcher`](#iappdispatcher) interface, which provides the same functionality without coupling to RTK Application specific contracts.

The following methods which were intended for internal use only will not be available to extensions via the `IAppDispatcher` interface:

```cs
    void Run();

    Task<bool> ShowExtensionInstaller(ExtensionBundle bundleToInstall);
    void ShowMain();
    void ShowSettings();
    void ShowExtensionManager();
```

To update code that is using `IAppUI`, you can simply do a find/replace of `IAppUI` with `IAppDispatcher` (and update your variable names accordingly.)

</details>

### `IGameInstance`

The `IGameInstance` type was split into `IGameInstance` and `ILoadedGameInstance`. This was don't for nullable correctness of when certain properties are available and when they have yet to be initialized.

Additionally, the `Properties` propertybag was removed in favor of extensions using `IExtensionStorage` for arbitrary global or per-account storage.

### `IMenuEntry`

`IMenuEntry` has deprecated `Image` in favor of a more portable `ImageUrl` property.

## Backward compatible breaks

### Constructor updates

Many new constructors were added to types to provide stricter nullability usage. As part of this change, all default constructors are marked as obsolete intended for deserialization only. You should change to using the new parameterized constructors where possible.

### Interface Removals

The following interfaces were not intended for use by extensions and have been removed from public libraries:

* `IAppService`
* `IAppUI` (see [IAppUI interface deprecated](#iappui-interface-deprecated))
* `IUpdateService`
* `INotificationManager`, `INotificationSink`, `INotification`
* `IGameInstanceManager`

### Namespace + Name changes

The following namespaces have been changed:

| Old type | New type |
|:--------------|:--------------|
|Raid.Toolkit.Extensibility.Host.IWindowManager | Raid.Toolkit.Extensibility.IWindowManager |
|Raid.Toolkit.Extensibility.Host.ExtensionManifest | Raid.Toolkit.Extensibility.PackageManifest |

## Breaking changes in v2.4

* Removed deprecated method `IExtensionHost.GetInstance`
* `IPackageLoader.LoadPackage` is now async and returns `Task<IExtensionPackage>`
